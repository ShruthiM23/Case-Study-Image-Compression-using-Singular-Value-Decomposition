# Case-Study-Image-Compression-using-Singular-Value-Decomposition

# Problem Statement
A study on the lossy Image Compression for grayscale and colored images using Singular Value Decomposition by comparing compression ratio and image size.

# Project Workflow:

1. Analysed the image under consideration(Grayscale)<br>
2. Applying SVD and decomposing the image into 3 vectors as U,S and V.<br>
3. Image reconstruction by comparing compression ratio and image size for different singular values(or rank).<br>
4. Performing steps 1,2, and 3 on a colored image.<br>

# Comparison of compression ratio of an image for different n_components:
